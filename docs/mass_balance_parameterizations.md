### 2 MASS BALANCE PARAMETERIZATIONS

The model computes the climatic mass balance for each elevation bin and timestep, estimates frontal ablation for marine-terminating glaciers at the end of each year (if this process is included), and updates the glacier geometry annually. The convention below follows Cogley et al. (2011). The total glacier-wide mass balance (Î”M) is thus estimated as:
