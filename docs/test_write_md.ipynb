    "# Introduction\n",
    "The Python Glacier Evolution Model (PyGEM) is an open-source glacier evolution model coded in Python that is designed to model the transient evolution of glaciers on regional and global scales. Each glacier is modeled independently using a given time step and elevation bins. The model computes the climatic mass balance (i.e., snow accumulation minus melt plus refreezing) for each elevation bin and each monthly time step. Glacier geometry is updated annually. The model outputs a variety of data including monthly mass balance and its components (accumulation, melt, refreezing, frontal ablation, glacier runoff),  and annual volume, volume below sea level, and area.\n",
    "\n",
    "PyGEM has a modular framework that allows different schemes to be used for model calibration or model physics (e.g., ablation, accumulation, refreezing, glacier dynamics). The most recent version of PyGEM, published in <em>Science</em> [(Rounce et al. 2023)](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abo1324), has been made compatible with the Open Global Glacier Model [(OGGM)](https://oggm.org/) to both leverage the pre-processing tools (e.g., digital elevation models, glacier characteristics) and their advances with respect to modeling glacier dynamics and ice thickness inversions.\n",

    "# Model Inputs\n",
    "The minimum data required to run the model is a glacier inventory, glacier characteristics (ice thickness, hypsometry, etc.), climate data, and mass balance data for calibration (Table 1). The model uses glacier outlines provided by the [Randolph Glacier Inventory](https://www.glims.org/RGI/) (RGI Consortium 2017; RGI 6.0 contains 215,547 glaciers globally). For debris-covered glaciers, spatially distributed sub-debris melt enhancement factors can be used to account for the enhanced or suppressed melting depending on the debris thickness [(Rounce et al. 2021)](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2020GL091311). OGGM is used to select a digital elevation model (DEM) for each glacier and bin the data according to the glacier central flowlines. OGGM can also be used to estimate each glacier’s initial ice thickness or use existing ice thickness estimates available from the [OGGM Shop](https://docs.oggm.org/en/stable/shop.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "For present-day (2000-2019) model runs, PyGEM currently uses monthly near-surface air temperature and precipitation data from ERA5 [(Hersbach et al. 2020)](https://rmets.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/qj.3803). Air temperature lapse rates are estimated using monthly air temperature data from various pressure levels. A second option is available to derive lapse rates from the neighboring pixels; however, this is for glaciers near the coast and therefore is not recommended. Additionally, the monthly temperature standard deviation is required if incorporating sub-monthly temperature variability in ablation (see below). Note that historical runs (e.g., 1980-2000) are challenging due to the lack of glacier inventories in the past; hence, one can assume the glacier area is constant or run the model in reverse (e.g., 1999, 1998, … , 1980). However, due to nonlinearities associated with the glacier dynamics running if the model is run in reverse and then forward, the glacier areas will be different in 2000 than the initial dataset; hence, caution must be used and the results should be evaluated carefully.\n",
    "\n",
    "For future (e.g., 2000-2100) model runs, PyGEM currently uses an ensemble of General Circulation Models (GCMs) and Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6). The model can also be run using Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) associated with CMIP5. Future simulations are adjusted using additive factors for air temperature and multiplicative factors for precipitation to remove any bias between the GCMs and ERA5 data over the calibration period (2000-2019). Additional bias corrections options will be available in the future.\n",

Additional calibration data is required to account for frontal ablation associated with marine-terminating glaciers. We envision the model continuously incorporating new large-scale systematic datasets as they become available. \n",

    "\n",
    "## Model Output\n",
    "The model outputs a variety of data including monthly mass balance and its components (accumulation, melt, refreezing, frontal ablation, glacier runoff), and annual mass, mass below sea level, and area. Results are written as a netcdf file (.nc) for each glacier. If multiple simulations are performed (e.g., for Monte Carlo simulations), then statistics related to the median and median absolute deviation are output for each parameter. In addition to this standard glacier-wide output, binned output is also available, which include the bin’s surface elevation, volume, thickness, and climatic mass balance annually. Additional output can be exported by modifying the **run_simulation.py** script."

To use these files and run the model one must clone the github repository onto your local machine.\n",

The code has been developed to automatically set up all file paths using relative paths from the PyGEM-Scripts directory, which is where the code is run from the command line. For example, a directory with the following subdirectories is recommended (see [sample files](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/13kiU00Zz2swN5OzwXiWIQTj_JLEHnDgZ)):\n",

The default option estimates refreezing based on the mean annual air temperature ([Woodward et al. 1997](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/annals-of-glaciology/article/influence-of-superimposedice-formation-on-the-sensitivity-of-glacier-mass-balance-to-climate-change/84DFA08E9CC8F28BE0729F1EBF4DA4E1)), while the alternative is based on heat conduction ([Huss and Hock, 2015](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/feart.2015.00054/full)).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Option 1: Mean annual air temperature\n",
    "For the default option, refreezing (R) is calculated for each elevation bin as a function of its weighted annual mean air temperature (Ta) following [Woodward et al. (1997)](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/annals-of-glaciology/article/influence-of-superimposedice-formation-on-the-sensitivity-of-glacier-mass-balance-to-climate-change/84DFA08E9CC8F28BE0729F1EBF4DA4E1)):\n",
    "$$R = -0.0069 \\cdot T_{a} + 0.000096$$\n",
    "The weighted annual mean accounts for the number of days in each month. Refreezing cannot be negative. The model assumes that refreezing occurs in the snowpack as opposed to being superimposed ice, so in the ablation zone the refreezing cannot exceed the snow depth. Since this option estimates annual refreezing, the equation above provides the maximum amount of potential refreezing. Each year, the potential refreezing is reset in October as this is the transition season from predominantly summer melt to winter accumulation. Therefore, it is possible that accumulated snow may melt and refreeze diurnally. The model replicates this physical behavior by first determining the amount of snow that has melted in that month. If the refreezing potential is greater than zero, the model assumes the snow melts and refreezes in the snow pack. Refreezing cannot exceed the amount of snow melt in any given month. The amount of refreezing is then subtracted from the potential refreezing until the potential refreezing is fully depleted or reset. Once the snow and refreezing completely melts, the model can melt the underlying ice/firn/snow.  This model is used as the default because it is computationally cheap compared to the alternative.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Option 2: Heat conduction\n",
    "The alternative option is to estimate refreezing using modeled snow and firn temperatures based on heat conduction as described by [Huss and Hock (2015)](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/feart.2015.00054/full). This option is significantly more computationally expensive. The code for this section was translated from the IDL code used in [Huss and Hock (2015)](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/feart.2015.00054/full), which potentially has an error in the heat conduction equation where the temperature in each layer is divided by a factor of 2 that Lilian Schuster identified is not physically-derived (as of 2021 - this error has not been fixed). This option should thus be used with caution until further developed."

    "Glacier dynamics in large-scale glacier evolution models typically rely on geometry changes like volume-area-length scaling (e.g., [Radić and Hock, 2011](https://www.nature.com/articles/ngeo1052)), mass redistribution using empirical equations (e.g., [Huss and Hock, 2015](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/feart.2015.00054/full)), or simplified glacier dynamics (e.g., [Maussion et al., 2019](https://gmd.copernicus.org/articles/12/909/2019/)). [Zekollari et al. (2022)](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2021RG000754) provide a comprehensive review of ice dynamics for mountain glaciers. These methods all allow the glacier to evolve over time in response to the total glacier-wide mass balance. The benefit of volume-area-length scaling and mass redistribution is they are computationally inexpensive compared to simplified glacier dynamics methods. The two options available in PyGEM are OGGM’s flowline model using the shallow ice approximation ([Maussion et al. 2019](https://gmd.copernicus.org/articles/12/909/2019/)) and mass redistribution curves ([Rounce et al. 2020](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/feart.2019.00331/full)).\n",

(2010)](https://hess.copernicus.org/articles/14/815/2010/hess-14-815-2010.html) but explicitly solve for area and ice thickness changes simultaneously to conserve mass. The approach is only applied to glaciers that have at least three elevation bins. Each year the glacier-wide mass balance is computed (see Mass Balance Section) and the mass is redistributed over the glacier using empirical equations that set the normalized surface elevation change ($\\Delta h$) as a function of the glacier’s elevation bins:\n",
    "$$\\Delta h = (h_{n} + a_{HH2015})^{\\gamma} + b_{HH2015} \\cdot (h_{n} + a_{HH2015}) + c_{HH2015} $$\n",

These coefficients vary depending on the size of the glacier ([Huss et al., 2010]((https://hess.copernicus.org/articles/14/815/2010/hess-14-815-2010.html))). In order to ensure that mass is conserved, i.e., the integration of the elevation change and glacier area (A) of each bin over all the elevation bins ($nbins$) is equal to the glacier-wide volume change ($\\Delta V$), an ice thickness scaling factor ($f_{s,HH2015}$) must be computed:\n",
    "$$f_{s,HH2015} = \\frac{\\Delta V}{\\sum_{i=0}^{nbins} A_{i} \\cdot \\Delta h_{i}} $$\n",
    "The volume change in each elevation bin ($\\Delta V_{bin}$) is computed as:\n",
    "$$\\Delta V_{bin} = f_{s,HH2015} \\cdot \\Delta h_{bin} \\cdot A_{bin} $$\n",

    "Glacier retreat occurs when the volume change in an elevation bin ($\\Delta V_{bin}$) causes the ice thickness for the next time step to be less than zero. In this case, the ice thickness is set to zero and the remaining volume change is redistributed over the entire glacier according to the mass redistribution described above. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Glacier advance\n",
    "Glacier advance occurs when the ice thickness change exceeds the ice thickness advance threshold (default: 5 m; [Huss and Hock, 2015](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/feart.2015.00054/full)). When this occurs, the ice thickness change is set to 5 m, the area and width of the bin are calculated accordingly, and the excess volume is recorded. The model then calculates the average area and thickness associated with the bins located in the glacier’s terminus, which is defined by the terminus percentage (default: 20%). However, this calculation excludes the bin actually located at the terminus because prior to adding a new elevation bin, the model checks that the bin located at the terminus is “full”. Specifically, the area and ice thickness of the lowermost bin are compared to the terminus’ average and if the area and ice thickness is less than the average, then the lowermost bin is first filled until it reaches the terminus average. This ensures that the lowermost bin is “full” and prevents adding new bins to a glacier that may only have a relatively small excess volume in consecutive years. In other words, if this criterion did not exist, then it would be possible to add new bins over multiple years that had small areas, which would appear as though the glacier was moving down a steep slope.\n",
    "\n",
    "If there is still excess volume remaining after filling the lowermost bin to the terminus average, then a new bin is added below the terminus. The ice thickness in this new bin is set to be equal to the terminus average and the area is computed based on the excess volume. If the area of this bin would be greater than the average area of the terminus, this indicates that an additional bin needs to be added. However, prior to adding an additional bin the excess volume is redistributed over the glacier again. This allows the glacier’s area and thickness to increase and prevents the glacier from having a thin layer of ice that advances down-valley without thickening.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two exceptions for when a glacier is not allowed to advance to a particular bin. The first exception is if the added bin would be below sea-level, in which case the remaining excess volume is redistributed over the entire glacier. The second exception is if the bin is over a known discontinuous section of the glacier, which is determined based on the initial glacier area. For example, it is possible, albeit unlikely, that a glacier could retreat over a discontinuous section of a glacier and then advance in the future. This discontinuous area is assumed to be a steep vertical drop, hence why a glacier currently does not exist, so a glacier is not allowed to form there in the future. The glacier instead skips over this discontinuous bin and a new bin is added below it."

Excess meltwater is distributed retroactively over all mass-balance years that are negative and where the lost mass is not regained in the future. For example, annual mass balances in year 6, 7 and 9 are negative, but all mass loss lost between year 6 and 10 is regained by the end of year 10; thus, excess meltwater is zero in years 6 to 10 despite negative annual mass balances. Excess meltwater for any year with negative mass balance cannot exceed the annual net mass loss of that year. The figure is copied from [Rounce et al.

    "The calibration option **‘emulator’** creates an independent emulator for each glacier that is derived by performing 100 present-day simulations based on randomly sampled model parameter sets and then fitting a Gaussian Process to these parameter-response pairs. This model replaces the mass balance model within the MCMC sampler (see Bayesian inference using MCMC below), which tests showed reduces the computational expense by two orders of magnitude. In the event that a single set of model parameters is desired, the emulator is also used to derive a set of model parameters following the same steps as ‘HH2015mod’.\n",

    "## Bayesian inference using Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods\n",
    "The calibration option ‘MCMC’ is the recommended option. Details of the methods are provided by Rounce et al. ([2020a](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-glaciology/article/quantifying-parameter-uncertainty-in-a-largescale-glacier-evolution-model-using-bayesian-inference-application-to-high-mountain-asia/61D8956E9A6C27CC1A5AEBFCDADC0432), [2023](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abo1324)). In short, Bayesian inference is performed using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods, which requires a mass balance observation (including the uncertainty represented by a standard deviation) and prior distributions. In an ideal world, we would have enough data to use broad prior distributions (e.g., uniform distributions), but unfortunately the model is overparameterized meaning there are an infinite number of parameter sets that give us a perfect fit. We therefore must use an empirical Bayes approach by which we use a simple optimization scheme (the **‘HH2015mod’** calibration option) to generate our prior distributions at the regional scale, and then use these prior distributions for the Bayesian inference. The prior distribution for the degree-day factor is based on previous data ([Braithwaite 2008](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-glaciology/article/temperature-and-precipitation-climate-at-the-equilibriumline-altitude-of-glaciers-expressed-by-the-degreeday-factor-for-melting-snow/6C2362F61B7DE7F153247A039736D54C)), while the temperature bias and precipitation factor are derived using a simple optimization scheme based on each RGI Order 2 subregion. The temperature bias assumes a normal distribution and the precipitation factor assumes a gamma distribution to ensure positivity. Glacier-wide winter mass balance data ([WGMS 2020](https://wgms.ch/data_databaseversions/)) are used to determine a reasonable upper-level constraint for the precipitation factor for the simple optimization scheme.\n",

    "The MCMC methods thus require several steps. First, set the <em>option_calibration = ‘emulator’</em> in **pygem_input.py**.

    "## Frontal Ablation Parameter for Marine-terminating Glaciers\n",
    "Marine-terminating glaciers have an additional frontal ablation parameter that is calibrated at the glacier-scale to match frontal ablation data [(Osmanoglu et al. 2013;](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/annals-of-glaciology/article/surface-velocity-and-ice-discharge-of-the-ice-cap-on-king-george-island-antarctica/62E511405ADD31A43FF52CDBC727A9D0) [2014;](https://tc.copernicus.org/articles/8/1807/2014/) [Minowa et al. 2021;](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012821X21000704) [Kochtitzky et al. 2022](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-33231-x)). Marine-terminating glaciers require a special procedure for calibration to avoid circularity issues. The initial ice thickness is estimated using the mass balance parameters assuming the glacier is land-terminating and a forward simulation from 2000-2020 estimates the frontal ablation. If a dynamic instability error occurs (8% of glaciers for [Rounce et al. 2023](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abo1324)), the glacier dynamics model uses [mass redistribution curves](mass_redistribution_curves_target) instead. For quality control, we combined the frontal ablation and geodetic mass balance observations to estimate climatic mass balances. For some glaciers, the resulting climatic mass balances are unrealistic due to errors in the RGI outlines and/or poor glacier thickness and velocity data used in frontal ablation calculations. For these glaciers, we assume frontal ablation is overestimated and reduce the frontal ablation to ensure the climatic mass balance is within three standard deviations of the regional mean from the geodetic mass balance data. The Antarctic and Subantarctic have the sparsest frontal ablation data, so the region’s median frontal ablation parameter and corresponding standard deviation is used for glaciers without data.\n",

    "# Limitations\n",
    "While PyGEM has a number of strengths, we also want to be transparent of several limitations that the current version has:\n",
    "* **Monthly timestep**: while we plan to add the option to use daily data in the future, the model is currently only set up for monthly timesteps.\n",
    "* **ERA5 climate data**: we currently use ERA5 data as our reference data and this is the only dataset that PyGEM currently supports. We are aware of recent studies that have shown reanalysis precipitation data have issues compared to other data (Alexander et al. 2020) and may consider alternative precipitation data in the future.  The class_climate.py script can be modified to incorporate others.\n",
    "* **Geodetic mass balance data**: while we envision adding options to incorporate other datasets (e.g., multiple mass balance datasets, mass balance gradients, snowline altitudes) for model calibration, the current framework is set up for a single glacier-wide mass balance observation for each glacier. Note that the geodetic mass balance data requires the time period to be specific with each observation; however, the time period does not have to be the same for each glacier.\n",
    "* **Glacier-specific workflow**: the model requires mass balance data for each glacier for model calibration. We hope to incorporate regional data as well in the future.\n",
    "* **Off-glacier snow accumulation**: when the glacier retreats, the model continues to compute accumulation, melt, and refreeze of snow over the deglaciated area. Glacier retreat may create off-glacier areas at high altitudes. At high altitudes, it’s possible for the temperature to be negative year-round and thereby cause off-glacier snow to accumulate unrealistically over time. Potential solutions could include removing the snow each year assuming that it sublimates, developing an avalanche parameterization to add the snow onto the glacier, or an alternative we have not yet considered. It is good to be aware of this since snow at this elevation will not contribute to off-glacier runoff since it doesn’t melt.\n",
    "* **Runoff for advancing glaciers**: when the glacier advances, the model continues to compute the runoff over the entire glacier area, which may exceed the initial glacierized area.\n",
    "* **Initialization at 2000**: the RGI is used to initialize the glacier areas. While the RGI targets all glacier extents to be from 2000, this may significantly vary depending on the source of the data. We assume the glacier extents represent 2000 and do not correct for these issues.\n",
    "* **Mass balance-ice thickness circularity issues**: circular issues exist regarding the derivation of the mass balance gradient and the ice thickness, i.e., a mass balance gradient is needed to estimate the ice thickness and yet the ice thickness will determine how the glacier evolves. To avoid these circularity issues, we calibrate the model assuming the glacier area is constant.\n",
    "* **Frontal ablation for marine-terminating glaciers**: currently the frontal ablation parameterization is only set up for marine-terminating glaciers based on the terminus type specific by the RGI. Theoretically, the same framework could be applied to lake-terminating glaciers, but to our knowledge, datasets for calibration are not yet available and the formation of lakes is not yet included in the model.\n",
    "* **PyMC2**: the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods are currently implemented using PyMC2. The developers of PyMC2 have created a new version PyMC3; however, the new version requires non-trivial changes to PyGEM’s mass balance code and therefore we continue to use PyMC2 at present. Building a conda environment that satisfies all the dependencies including PyMC2 can be challenging, and likely will become increasingly challenging in the future. We hope to develop a new calibration framework in 2023/2024 that is easier to install.\n",
    "* **Continual development**: PyGEM is constantly evolving. We will do our best to keep documents updated, but it's always helpful to let us know if you're using PyGEM so we can ensure you are aware of the latest and/or upcoming changes."
