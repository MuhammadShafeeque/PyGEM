    "# Introduction\n",
    "The Python Glacier Evolution Model (PyGEM) is an open-source glacier evolution model coded in Python that is designed to model the transient evolution of glaciers on regional and global scales. Each glacier is modeled independently using a given time step and elevation bins. The model computes the climatic mass balance (i.e., snow accumulation minus melt plus refreezing) for each elevation bin and each monthly time step. Glacier geometry is updated annually. The model outputs a variety of data including monthly mass balance and its components (accumulation, melt, refreezing, frontal ablation, glacier runoff),  and annual volume, volume below sea level, and area.\n",
    "\n",
    "PyGEM has a modular framework that allows different schemes to be used for model calibration or model physics (e.g., ablation, accumulation, refreezing, glacier dynamics). The most recent version of PyGEM, published in <em>Science</em> [(Rounce et al. 2023)](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abo1324), has been made compatible with the Open Global Glacier Model [(OGGM)](https://oggm.org/) to both leverage the pre-processing tools (e.g., digital elevation models, glacier characteristics) and their advances with respect to modeling glacier dynamics and ice thickness inversions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Model Inputs\n",
    "The minimum data required to run the model is a glacier inventory, glacier characteristics (ice thickness, hypsometry, etc.), climate data, and mass balance data for calibration (Table 1). The model uses glacier outlines provided by the [Randolph Glacier Inventory](https://www.glims.org/RGI/) (RGI Consortium 2017; RGI 6.0 contains 215,547 glaciers globally). For debris-covered glaciers, spatially distributed sub-debris melt enhancement factors can be used to account for the enhanced or suppressed melting depending on the debris thickness [(Rounce et al. 2021)](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2020GL091311). OGGM is used to select a digital elevation model (DEM) for each glacier and bin the data according to the glacier central flowlines. OGGM can also be used to estimate each glacier’s initial ice thickness or use existing ice thickness estimates available from the [OGGM Shop](https://docs.oggm.org/en/stable/shop.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "For present-day (2000-2019) model runs, PyGEM currently uses monthly near-surface air temperature and precipitation data from ERA5 [(Hersbach et al. 2020)](https://rmets.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/qj.3803). Air temperature lapse rates are estimated using monthly air temperature data from various pressure levels. A second option is available to derive lapse rates from the neighboring pixels; however, this is for glaciers near the coast and therefore is not recommended. Additionally, the monthly temperature standard deviation is required if incorporating sub-monthly temperature variability in ablation (see below). Note that historical runs (e.g., 1980-2000) are challenging due to the lack of glacier inventories in the past; hence, one can assume the glacier area is constant or run the model in reverse (e.g., 1999, 1998, … , 1980). However, due to nonlinearities associated with the glacier dynamics running if the model is run in reverse and then forward, the glacier areas will be different in 2000 than the initial dataset; hence, caution must be used and the results should be evaluated carefully.\n",
    "\n",
    "For future (e.g., 2000-2100) model runs, PyGEM currently uses an ensemble of General Circulation Models (GCMs) and Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6). The model can also be run using Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) associated with CMIP5. Future simulations are adjusted using additive factors for air temperature and multiplicative factors for precipitation to remove any bias between the GCMs and ERA5 data over the calibration period (2000-2019). Additional bias corrections options will be available in the future.\n",

    "\n",
    "PyGEM computes the climatic mass balance for each elevation bin and timestep, estimates frontal ablation for marine-terminating glaciers at the end of each year (if this process is included), and updates the glacier geometry annually. The convention below follows [Cogley et al. (2011)](https://wgms.ch/downloads/Cogley_etal_2011.pdf). The total glacier-wide mass balance ($\\Delta M$) is thus estimated as:\n",
    "$$\\Delta M = B_{clim} + A_{f}/S $$\n",

    "### Option 2: monthly temperatures with daily variance\n",
    "The second option incorporates the daily variance associated with the temperature for each month according to Huss and Hock (2015):\n",

The values of $f$ for these various surface types are assumed to be related to one another to reduce the number of model parameters. The default ratio of the $f_{snow}$ to the $f_{ice}$ is 0.7, and $f_{firn}$ is assumed to be the mean of the $f_{snow}$ and $f_{ice}$; however, the user may change these values in the input file if desired. The values for $f_{debris}$ are equal to $f_{ice}$ multiplied by the mean sub-debris melt enhancement factor [(Rounce et al. 2021)](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2020GL091311) for the given elevation bin.\n",

The temperature bias is one of three model parameters that is calibrated and serves to account for any biases resulting from the use of coarse climate data that is unable to capture local topographic variations.

The precipitation factor is a model parameter that is used to adjust from the climate data to the glacier, which could be caused by local topographic effects due to differences in elevation, rain shadow effects, etc. The precipitation gradient is another model parameter, which is used to redistribute the precipitation along the glacier and can be thought of as a precipitation lapse rate. Typical values for the precipitation gradient vary from 0.01 – 0.025% m$^{-1}$([Huss and Hock, 2015](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/feart.2015.00054/full) who cited [WGMS, 2012](https://wgms.ch/products_fog/)). The default assumes a precipitation gradient of 0.01% m$^{-1}$ to reduce the number of model parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, for glaciers with high relief (> 1000 m), the precipitation in the uppermost 25% of the glacier’s elevation is reduced using an exponential function ([Huss and Hock, 2015](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/feart.2015.00054/full)):\n",

The adjusted precipitation cannot be lower than 87.5% of the maximum precipitation on the glacier. This adjustment accounts for the reduced air moisture and increased wind erosion at higher elevations ([Benn and Lehmkuhl, 2000](https://risweb.st-andrews.ac.uk/portal/en/researchoutput/mass-balance-and-equilibriumline-altitudes-of-glaciers-in-highmountain-environments(080f17fc-33dd-4805-bc97-a5aaa018a457)/export.html))."

    "## Refreezing\n",
    "There are two model options for computing refreezing.  The default option estimates refreezing based on the mean annual air temperature ([Woodward et al. 1997](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/annals-of-glaciology/article/influence-of-superimposedice-formation-on-the-sensitivity-of-glacier-mass-balance-to-climate-change/84DFA08E9CC8F28BE0729F1EBF4DA4E1)), while the alternative is based on heat conduction ([Huss and Hock, 2015](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/feart.2015.00054/full)).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Option 1: Mean annual air temperature\n",
    "For the default option, refreezing (R) is calculated for each elevation bin as a function of its weighted annual mean air temperature (Ta) following [Woodward et al. (1997)](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/annals-of-glaciology/article/influence-of-superimposedice-formation-on-the-sensitivity-of-glacier-mass-balance-to-climate-change/84DFA08E9CC8F28BE0729F1EBF4DA4E1)):\n",
    "$$R = -0.0069 \\cdot T_{a} + 0.000096$$\n",
    "The weighted annual mean accounts for the number of days in each month. Refreezing cannot be negative. The model assumes that refreezing occurs in the snowpack as opposed to being superimposed ice, so in the ablation zone the refreezing cannot exceed the snow depth. Since this option estimates annual refreezing, the equation above provides the maximum amount of potential refreezing. Each year, the potential refreezing is reset in October as this is the transition season from predominantly summer melt to winter accumulation. Therefore, it is possible that accumulated snow may melt and refreeze diurnally. The model replicates this physical behavior by first determining the amount of snow that has melted in that month. If the refreezing potential is greater than zero, the model assumes the snow melts and refreezes in the snow pack. Refreezing cannot exceed the amount of snow melt in any given month. The amount of refreezing is then subtracted from the potential refreezing until the potential refreezing is fully depleted or reset. Once the snow and refreezing completely melts, the model can melt the underlying ice/firn/snow.  This model is used as the default because it is computationally cheap compared to the alternative.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Option 2: Heat conduction\n",
    "The alternative option is to estimate refreezing using modeled snow and firn temperatures based on heat conduction as described by [Huss and Hock (2015)](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/feart.2015.00054/full). This option is significantly more computationally expensive. The code for this section was translated from the IDL code used in Huss and Hock (2015), which potentially has an error in the heat conduction equation where the temperature in each layer is divided by a factor of 2 that Lilian Schuster identified is not physically-derived (as of 2021 - this error has not been fixed). This option should thus be used with caution until further developed."

The approach is only applied to glaciers that have at least three elevation bins. Each year the glacier-wide mass balance is computed (see Mass Balance Section) and the mass is redistributed over the glacier using empirical equations that set the normalized surface elevation change ($\\Delta h$) as a function of the glacier’s elevation bins:\n",
    "$$\\Delta h = (h_{n} + a_{HH2015})^{\\gamma} + b_{HH2015} \\cdot (h_{n} + a_{HH2015}) + c_{HH2015} $$\n",
    "where $h_{n}$ is the normalized elevation according to $\\frac{z_{max} - z_{bin}}{z_{max} - z_{min}}$ and $a_{HH2015)$, $b_{HH2015)$, $c_{HH2015)$, and $\\gamma$ are all calibrated coefficients based on 34 glaciers in the Swiss Alps. These coefficients vary depending on the size of the glacier ([Huss et al., 2010]((https://hess.copernicus.org/articles/14/815/2010/hess-14-815-2010.html))). In order to ensure that mass is conserved, i.e., the integration of the elevation change and glacier area (A) of each bin over all the elevation bins ($nbins$) is equal to the glacier-wide volume change ($\\Delta V$), an ice thickness scaling factor ($f_{s,HH2015}$) must be computed:\n",
    "$$f_{s,HH2015} = \\frac{\\Delta V}{\\sum_{i=0}^{nbins} A_{i} \\cdot \\Delta h_{i}} $$\n",
    "The volume change in each elevation bin ($\\Delta V_{bin}$) is computed as:\n",
    "$$\\Delta V_{bin} = f_{s,HH2015} \\cdot \\Delta h_{bin} \\cdot A_{bin} $$\n",
    "Depending on the bed shape (parabolic, triangular or rectangular) of the glacier, the resulting area, ice thickness ($H$), and width ($W$) can be solved for explicitly based on mass conservation and the use of similar shapes:\n",
    "$$H_{bin,t+1} \\cdot A_{bin,t+1} = H_{bin,t} \\cdot A_{bin,t} + \\Delta V_{bin} $$\n",
    "$$\\frac{H_{bin,t+1}}{H_{bin,t}} \\alpha \\frac{A_{bin,t+1}}{A_bin,t} $$\n",
    "This is a marked improvement over previous studies that have not explicitly solved for the area and ice thickness changes simultaneously, which can lead to mass loss or gain that is then corrected ([Huss and Hock, 2015](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/feart.2015.00054/full)).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Glacier retreat\n",
    "Glacier retreat occurs when the volume change in an elevation bin ($\\Delta V_{bin}$) causes the ice thickness for the next time step to be less than zero. In this case, the ice thickness is set to zero and the remaining volume change is redistributed over the entire glacier according to the mass redistribution described above. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Glacier advance\n",
    "Glacier advance occurs when the ice thickness change exceeds the ice thickness advance threshold (default: 5 m; [Huss and Hock, 2015](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/feart.2015.00054/full)). When this occurs, the ice thickness change is set to 5 m, the area and width of the bin are calculated accordingly, and the excess volume is recorded. The model then calculates the average area and thickness associated with the bins located in the glacier’s terminus, which is defined by the terminus percentage (default: 20%). However, this calculation excludes the bin actually located at the terminus because prior to adding a new elevation bin, the model checks that the bin located at the terminus is “full”. Specifically, the area and ice thickness of the lowermost bin are compared to the terminus’ average and if the area and ice thickness is less than the average, then the lowermost bin is first filled until it reaches the terminus average. This ensures that the lowermost bin is “full” and prevents adding new bins to a glacier that may only have a relatively small excess volume in consecutive years. In other words, if this criterion did not exist, then it would be possible to add new bins over multiple years that had small areas, which would appear as though the glacier was moving down a steep slope.\n",
    "\n",
    "If there is still excess volume remaining after filling the lowermost bin to the terminus average, then a new bin is added below the terminus. The ice thickness in this new bin is set to be equal to the terminus average and the area is computed based on the excess volume. If the area of this bin would be greater than the average area of the terminus, this indicates that an additional bin needs to be added. However, prior to adding an additional bin the excess volume is redistributed over the glacier again. This allows the glacier’s area and thickness to increase and prevents the glacier from having a thin layer of ice that advances down-valley without thickening.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two exceptions for when a glacier is not allowed to advance to a particular bin. The first exception is if the added bin would be below sea-level, in which case the remaining excess volume is redistributed over the entire glacier. The second exception is if the bin is over a known discontinuous section of the glacier, which is determined based on the initial glacier area. For example, it is possible, albeit unlikely, that a glacier could retreat over a discontinuous section of a glacier and then advance in the future. This discontinuous area is assumed to be a steep vertical drop, hence why a glacier currently does not exist, so a glacier is not allowed to form there in the future. The glacier instead skips over this discontinuous bin and a new bin is added below it."
