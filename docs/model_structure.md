# Model Structure
The model is written in Python. The model is currently available as two repositories on github.
PyGEM (https://github.com/drounce/PyGEM) contains the main model code.  This repository can now be installed in your environment with PyPI (https://pypi.org/project/pygem/) using "pip install pygem".
PyGEM-scripts (https://github.com/drounce/PyGEM-scripts) contains general scripts used to run the model (e.g., run_calibration.py, run_simulation.py) as well as the post-processing, analysis scripts (e.g., analyze_simulations.py). To use these files and run the model one must clone the github repository onto your local machine.
