Python Glacier Evolution Model (PyGEM)

Overview: Python Glacier Evolution Model (PyGEM) is an open-source glacier evolution model coded in Python that models the transient evolution of glaciers. Each glacier is modeled independently using a monthly timestep. PyGEM has a modular framework that allows different schemes to be used for model calibration or model physics (e.g., climatic mass balance, glacier dynamics).

Manual: (Add model user manual or link to model user manual here)

Usage: PyGEM is meant for large-scale glacier evolution modeling, i.e., for regional or global applications.

Contributing: We welcome contributions from any interested parties and are in the process of outlining how to best incorporate outside contributions. If you would like to contribute to the development of the model, please contact David Rounce (drounce@alaska.edu).
